/*
üéØ HOW TO USE THIS FILE:

1. üìã Copy any query above and run it in your SQL client
2. üîÑ Modify the LIMIT values to see more/fewer results
3. üé≤ Run query #13 multiple times for different random routes
4. üîç Use these as starting points for your own investigations
5. üìä Export results to CSV for visualization in tools like Excel, Tableau, or Python

üåü ADVANCED EXPLORATION IDEAS:

- Combine journey time data with stop locations for mapping
- Create time-based heatmaps using hourly data
- Build route optimization algorithms
- Analyze accessibility patterns across Hong Kong
- Find the busiest transit corridors
- Identify underserved areas

üí° PRO TIPS:

- Use ST_AsText(geometry) to see coordinates in readable format
- Try ST_Buffer() for finding stops within a radius
- Experiment with different SIMILARITY() thresholds for fuzzy matching
- Add WHERE clauses to filter by specific areas or route types

Happy exploring! üöå‚ú®
