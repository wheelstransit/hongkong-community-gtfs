An open-source, community-driven project to generate accurate and up-to-date procedural GTFS and GTFS-RT feeds for Hong Kong's public transport network.

## Why?
Public transport data provided by official sources in Hong Kong is often fragmented, inaccurate, or incomplete. This project aims to solve that problem by creating a single, high-quality, and reliable set of GTFS feeds.

## Who?
Currently *the code of* Hong Kong Community GTFS is maintained by Wheels, an upcoming transit app by riders, for riders. For more information on Wheels, follow [@anscg_](https://threads.com/anscg_) ðŸ˜‰

## How
Instead of manual editing, this project generates the feeds **procedurally**. We combine data from open sources like OpenStreetMap with official data from portals like `data.gov.hk` to algorithmically build the GTFS files. This makes the process transparent, repeatable, and easier to keep up-to-date.

## Quality
The primary motivation for this project is the poor quality of existing data. Therefore, our core mission is to produce the most accurate, complete, and reliable GTFS feed possible for Hong Kong. **We pursue the best and finest quality not as a feature, but as a fundamental requirement.**
